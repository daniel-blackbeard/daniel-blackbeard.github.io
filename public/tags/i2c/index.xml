      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you perhaps know, I&amp;rsquo;m working on this blog also as a way to log my learning journey. So, to support the lack of interesting peripherals on the Arty A7, I bought a set of modules for Arduino. Most of them quite uninteresting, but I got this I2S DAC module from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adafruit.com/product/3678&#34;&gt;Adafruit&lt;/a&gt; that implements the UDA1334A from NXP (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/UDA1334ATS.pdf&#34;&gt;datasheet&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This device interest me the most among the ones I got from the assortment, because since I was a kid I wanted to make my own guitar effects (in fact, I believe many electronic engineers are born this way or similar), so the end goal is quite ambitious as you can see. But let&amp;rsquo;s start from something easy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
