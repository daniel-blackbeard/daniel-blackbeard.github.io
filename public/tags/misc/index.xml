      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me be brief, as this is just to fill the emptyness of a newly created blog: I want to learn new skills and take notes that can be shared with people in the hope they will find useful as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog I have the plan to showcase my personal projects on electronics and perhaps other fields, maybe adding some of the knowledge I have accumulated in the last years in the field (if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t break any NDA, of course).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
