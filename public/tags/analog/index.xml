      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to come with worthy content, but here I am. I have been working on getting my FPGA board to sample analog audio with the internal ADC for a project proposed by a colleague as a way to learn the intricacies of digital design. Let me tell you straight: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug480_7Series_XADC&#34;&gt;documentation about the ADC of this Artix 7&lt;/a&gt; device does a great job at being confusing. I&amp;rsquo;m not ashamed to say that this is the part that took me the longest to figure, also considering the paranoia about damaging the components with non-compliant voltages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
