I used to write blocks back in the 2010’s about machine learning, data science and numerical simulation of complex systems. With the years I moved onto different things and removed the blog references. But in the end I like the learning process that allows the writing and summarizing information. If other people can understand it, that means I got it right. Akin to the teacher learning from the student, just that the student is me as well."},"title":"_index"},"/blog/20250525_introduction/":{"data":{"":"Placeholder for the future content as well here"},"title":"Blog introduction"}}
