      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after you are done with the book and implemented your first 8-bit CPU you keep wondering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok, but now I want to do real world stuff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I got you back, nothing comes before when it comes to real world stuff that having the capability of sending data to/from other devices. When I began my personal projects, when I got my Arty A7, I thought that I needed to be able to debug what&amp;rsquo;s happening inside the FPGA when the internal logic analyzer might not be too reliable (pro-tip: it&amp;rsquo;s very reliable). So being able to send to a computer data using a simple protocol is a must.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What Is HDL? The explanation you did not requested</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a hardware engineer you need no explanation though, this is more for the programming guys who attempt to make things with an FPGA in the belief that is the next step of Arduino (I do think that though, so no judgment made here)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who wrote a lot of code in my young age (still loving fiddling with Linux kernel), I&amp;rsquo;m lucky I got the purpose of HDL.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me be brief, as this is just to fill the emptyness of a newly created blog: I want to learn new skills and take notes that can be shared with people in the hope they will find useful as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog I have the plan to showcase my personal projects on electronics and perhaps other fields, maybe adding some of the knowledge I have accumulated in the last years in the field (if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t break any NDA, of course).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
