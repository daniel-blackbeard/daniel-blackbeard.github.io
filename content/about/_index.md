# About
I'm Daniel, a microelectronics engineer working on cutting edge optical links, but with a general passion for electronics since I was 13 years old.

## Why this blog is necessary?
I used to write blocks back in the 2010's about machine learning, data science and numerical simulation of complex systems. With the years I moved onto different things and removed the blog references. But in the end I like the learning process that allows the writing and summarizing information. If other people can understand it, that means I got it right. Akin to the teacher learning from the student, just that the student is me as well.
